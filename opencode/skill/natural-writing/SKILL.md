# Natural Writing

LLMs produce statistically average text. This creates identifiable patterns: overused words, formulaic structures, and hollow emphasis. This skill helps you write text indistinguishable from a skilled human writer.

## Core Principle

**Specific beats generic. Facts beat significance claims. Direct beats hedged.**

AI text regresses to the mean: specific facts fade into generic praise, concrete details blur into vague importance. Fight this by being concrete and direct.

## Vocabulary Red Flags

These words appear far more frequently in AI text than human text. One or two is fine; clustering several is a tell.

### High-Alert Words

Avoid or use sparingly: `delve`, `tapestry`, `vibrant`, `landscape` (metaphorical), `nuanced`, `multifaceted`, `pivotal`, `crucial`, `foster`, `underscore`, `highlight`, `showcase`, `leverage`, `navigate`, `realm`, `intricate`, `comprehensive`, `robust`, `seamless`, `cutting-edge`, `game-changing`, `groundbreaking`

### Filler Transitions

Cut or replace: `Additionally`, `Furthermore`, `Moreover`, `It's worth noting`, `It's important to remember`, `Interestingly`

### Hollow Emphasis

Never use: `testament to`, `speaks volumes`, `indelible mark`, `rich tapestry`, `stands as a reminder`, `plays a vital/crucial/pivotal role`, `underscores the importance`

## Structural Anti-Patterns

### 1. Negative Parallelisms

AI loves "not only X but also Y" and "it's not just X, it's Y" constructions.

```
BAD:  "It's not just a tool, it's a paradigm shift."
BAD:  "Not only does it improve performance, but it also enhances readability."
GOOD: "It improves performance and readability."
GOOD: "The tool changed how we approach the problem."
```

### 2. Rule of Three Abuse

AI defaults to triple-adjective and triple-phrase patterns.

```
BAD:  "A powerful, flexible, and intuitive solution."
BAD:  "It enables collaboration, innovation, and growth."
GOOD: "A flexible solution." (pick the most accurate one)
GOOD: "It enables better collaboration."
```

### 3. Superficial "-ing" Analysis

AI attaches vague significance via participle phrases.

```
BAD:  "The API returns JSON, enabling seamless integration."
BAD:  "She won the award, cementing her legacy in the field."
GOOD: "The API returns JSON."
GOOD: "She won the award."
```

If the significance is real and non-obvious, state it directly as its own sentence with specifics.

### 4. Challenges and Future Outlook

AI loves concluding with "Despite challenges..." or "Looking ahead..." sections.

```
BAD:  "Despite these challenges, the project continues to evolve."
BAD:  "The future holds exciting possibilities for..."
GOOD: (Just end. Or state specific next steps if relevant.)
```

### 5. False Ranges

AI uses "from X to Y" where X and Y aren't endpoints of a real scale.

```
BAD:  "From authentication to deployment, the platform handles everything."
BAD:  "From technical skills to soft skills, she excels in all areas."
GOOD: "The platform handles authentication, testing, and deployment."
GOOD: "She has strong technical and communication skills."
```

### 6. Elegant Variation Gone Wrong

AI avoids repeating words by swapping in synonyms that create confusion.

```
BAD:  "The function processes data. The method then validates the information. 
       This procedure ensures the content is correct."
       (function/method/procedure and data/information/content mean the same thing)
GOOD: "The function processes data, validates it, and returns the result."
```

Repeat words when they refer to the same thing. Clarity beats variety.

## Hollow Emphasis Patterns

AI compensates for lack of specific information by asserting importance.

### Legacy/Significance Claims

```
BAD:  "This represents a pivotal moment in the evolution of..."
BAD:  "The findings underscore the enduring significance of..."
BAD:  "Her work continues to shape the landscape of..."
GOOD: State what actually happened. Let readers judge significance.
```

### Vague Attribution

```
BAD:  "Experts argue that..."
BAD:  "It has been widely recognized that..."
BAD:  "Industry observers note..."
GOOD: Name the source or cut the claim.
```

### Promotional Puffery

```
BAD:  "A stunning achievement that captivates audiences."
BAD:  "Nestled in the heart of the valley..."
BAD:  "Boasts an impressive array of features."
GOOD: Describe what it actually is/does.
```

## Style Defaults

### Punctuation

- Avoid em dashes. Use commas, parentheses, or separate sentences.
- Use straight quotes and apostrophes, not curly.
- One exclamation point per document maximum, if any.

### Sentence Structure

- Vary sentence length naturally.
- Start sentences with different words.
- Front-load important information.

### Tone

- Direct, not hedged.
- Confident, not defensive.
- Specific, not sweeping.

## Quick Self-Check

Before finalizing text, scan for:

1. **Word clusters**: Multiple red-flag words in one paragraph?
2. **Triple patterns**: Adjective triplets or phrase triplets?
3. **Significance assertions**: Claiming importance without specifics?
4. **Filler transitions**: Starting paragraphs with "Additionally" or "Furthermore"?
5. **Em dash density**: More than one per few paragraphs?

If you spot these patterns, revise. Cut the filler. Add specifics or remove the claim.

<IMPORTANT>
The goal is not to avoid every word on the list. The goal is to avoid the PATTERNS:
- Generic over specific
- Hollow emphasis over concrete facts  
- Formulaic structures over natural variation
- Asserting significance over demonstrating it

One "crucial" is fine. "Crucial", "pivotal", "testament", and "landscape" in the same paragraph is a tell.
