description: Reflect on completed work and generate learnings for future AI agents
---

Reflect on the work you just completed in this conversation. Generate concise, information-dense instructions for future AI agents based on your learnings.

Focus on:

- **Techniques that worked well** — approaches, patterns, or methods that were effective
- **Gotchas/pitfalls encountered** — things that were tricky, unexpected, or easy to get wrong

## Instructions

1. Review the conversation history
2. Read the existing `LEARNINGS.md` file in the project root (if it exists) to avoid duplication.
3. Write new learnings as bullet points, grouped under `## Techniques` and `## Gotchas` headings.
4. Merge new learnings into the existing file, or create it if it doesn't exist.
5. Write learnings as instructions to future AI agents.
6. Always add at least one observation.
7. Be concise but don't sacrifice important information in the name of brevity.
